ArchiDroid 2.1.5
- [!] Round #1 of BIG Aroma cleaning
# Aroma has been redesigned completely. All freezing bugs are nearly gone, it's now much more newbie-friendly and Custom preset doesn't "hurt" anyone anymore.
# Please note that this are really HUGE changes and it's not finished yet. I'm releasing it already because old aroma is a pain in the a** and I want to get rid of it as soon as possible.
# If you encounter any bugs please let me now. I think you'll really enjoy this change, as I spent at least a few hours working on it.
